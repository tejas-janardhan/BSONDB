Philosophy -

External API must have flexible inputs, and varied functions that manipulate the internal API
Internal API must have hard inputs.

About Project -

Internal Notes:

Date objects get converted to string in the collection. and retrieved as strings

Nature of exceptions vs returning nothing [] , null or undefined

TODO
Write test suite to keep it in check.
